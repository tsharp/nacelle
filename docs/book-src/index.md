# nacelle documentation

nacelle is an experimental Tokio-based Rust library for streaming application
handlers across raw TCP and HTTP transports.

This book is the narrative documentation site. It follows the same broad
delivery model as the Rust Book: chapter-oriented Markdown, search, keyboard
navigation, and a local/offline build. Its content is organized like Django's
documentation:

- **Tutorials** take you through a working path.
- **Topic guides** explain concepts and design choices.
- **How-to guides** solve specific operational tasks.
- **Reference** pages document exact behavior and APIs.

Rust API reference is still generated separately with `cargo doc`.

## Start here

If you are new to nacelle, read:

1. [Getting started](tutorials/getting-started.md)
2. [Architecture](topics/architecture.md)
3. [Configure production limits](how-to/configure-production.md)

If you are validating performance, read:

1. [Run the stress harness](tutorials/stress-harness.md)
2. [Compare performance profiles](how-to/compare-performance.md)
3. [Performance model](topics/performance-model.md)

Internal readiness plans and assessments live under `docs/internal` and are not
part of this public book.
