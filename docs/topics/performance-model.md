# Performance model

nacelle's high-throughput TCP path is sensitive to small per-request costs.
When comparing runs, keep these variables fixed:

- commit
- Linux kernel and CPU governor
- allocator configuration
- server threads
- connection count
- pipeline depth
- payload size
- TLS versus plain TCP
- stress client version

Use the performance how-to for repeatable command lines.

The current `main` branch has been observed around 1.9M RPS on Linux for the TCP benchmark path. This branch should be compared against that baseline on the same host, kernel, CPU governor, allocator settings, and command line.

Suggested local benchmark:

```bash
cargo bench -p nacelle --features bench,reference_protocol
```

The `runtime_limits` benchmark group covers connection/request permit
acquire/drop and memory allocation overhead. Watch it closely after changes to
`NacelleRuntimeState`.

Suggested RPS comparison:

```bash
./examples/run-stress-test.sh --config examples/nacelle-stress-server/configs/tcp.toml --server-threads 48 --connections 256 --pipeline 8 --duration-secs 30 --payload-bytes 256
```

The default stress server build also prints a compact OTel console snapshot every
5 seconds. Request metrics are grouped under the generic telemetry
`request_metrics` config; started/completed counters and byte counters are on by
default, while in-flight and duration metrics remain opt-in. Request duration
metrics are opt-in as well, which avoids request `Instant` work on core/HTTP
paths unless duration metrics or HTTP access logs are enabled. Use
`--no-byte-metrics` when comparing the cost of byte accounting, and use
`--no-default-features` with the plain TCP config for a metrics-free baseline.

The checked-in root `config.toml` enables self-signed TCP TLS for local
stress runs. For the plain TCP throughput baseline, use
`examples/nacelle-stress-server/configs/tcp.toml`. Compare TLS and non-TLS runs
separately:

```bash
./examples/run-stress-test.sh --config examples/nacelle-stress-server/configs/tcp.toml
./examples/run-stress-test.sh --config examples/nacelle-stress-server/configs/tcp-low-memory.toml
./examples/run-stress-test.sh --config examples/nacelle-stress-server/configs/tcp-tls.toml
```

The `examples/run-stress-test.sh` and `examples/run-stress-test.ps1` helpers
apply root `config.toml` first, then the selected profile, and choose the
matching client mode automatically.

Guardrails:

- keep shutdown task tracking at the connection/listener boundary
- avoid per-request locks in the TCP hot path
- keep telemetry sinks optional; default operation should not push into in-memory sinks
- preserve single-chunk body fast paths
- tune TCP buffer sizes for the connection count instead of relying on large defaults
