# Architecture

Nacelle is organized as a small core plus protocol-specific transport crates.

## Crate Layout

- `nacelle-core`: shared handler, request/response body, limits, lifecycle, telemetry, and provider-neutral TLS metadata.
- `nacelle-openssl`: OpenSSL configuration reload and negotiated metadata extraction.
- `nacelle-rustls`: Rustls configuration reload, certificate parsing, SNI policy, and negotiated metadata extraction.
- `nacelle-tcp`: TCP/Unix socket server, protocol trait, connection loop, and listener runtime.
- `nacelle-http`: Hyper HTTP/1 server, HTTP request policy, and HTTP TLS listener integration.
- `nacelle`: convenience crate with `core`, `codec`, `tcp`, `http`, and
  `runtime` capability namespaces.
- `examples/nacelle-reference-protocol`: unpublished length-delimited protocol
  fixture used by examples, tests, benchmarks, and stress tools.
- `examples/nacelle-examples`: unpublished runnable examples and benchmarks.

The reference protocol intentionally stays out of `nacelle-core` and
`nacelle-tcp`. It demonstrates the public protocol and codec contracts without
becoming part of the published library API.

## App Core And Protocol Adapters

Nacelle is organized so application behavior lives behind statically dispatched
handler boundaries. TCP handlers receive `TcpRequestContext<P>` and complete
requests with the response type associated with `P`. HTTP handlers receive
`HttpRequestContext<State>` and complete through `HttpResponse`.

TCP `Protocol` implementations are adapters: they decode a wire format into
request metadata and encode responses back into frames. Swapping protocols
should not require rewriting the app core. The app-first serving path wires
concrete typed servers together with
`NacelleApp::new().tcp(...).http(...).run()`. The app owns shared runtime state,
telemetry, shutdown, and supervision. `nacelle::runtime::NacelleHost` remains
available for services that need manual listener control.

Provider-neutral TLS identity and per-connection metadata live in `nacelle-core`.
Concrete configuration, certificate handling, reload policy, and negotiated
metadata extraction live in `nacelle-rustls` and `nacelle-openssl`. Transport
crates retain listener lifecycle and async I/O adaptation so provider crates do
not depend back on TCP or HTTP. The `nacelle` facade preserves the `rustls`,
`openssl`, and `tls-self-signed` feature names and exposes provider namespaces.

## Request Flow

```text
listener
  -> connection limit
  -> connection task
  -> protocol/HTTP decode
  -> request limit
  -> handler
  -> response body encode/stream
```

TCP and Unix socket listeners use the `nacelle-tcp` `Protocol` trait and its
associated request, response, and connection-state types to decode request
heads and encode bounded response frames. HTTP uses `nacelle-http` with Hyper
HTTP/1 and a transport-owned typed request/response pipeline.

Connection metadata carries the transport, a stable connection id, listener
label, peer and local addresses, local Unix socket path, effective peer IP, and
TLS metadata. The typed TCP pipeline presents this immutable metadata to
handlers as `ConnectionInfo` through `RequestContext`.

The pipeline model for connection-local application state is
`ConnectionContext<State>`. TCP protocols construct `Protocol::ConnectionState`
once per accepted connection. `TcpServer` and `LocalTcpServer` expose shared
state as `Arc<P::ConnectionState>`. `SerialTcpServer` and
`LocalSerialTcpServer` instead lend `&mut ConnectionContext<P::ConnectionState>`
to exactly one awaited handler at a time, avoiding an async mutex for state
confined to one serial connection loop. No dynamic extension map participates
in either request path.

The shared multi-thread Tokio runtime remains the default. Experimental
thread-per-core execution is explicit and currently supports TCP, HTTP, Rustls
TCP/HTTPS, required OpenSSL TCP, and optional plaintext/OpenSSL TCP on Linux. Each selected worker owns a
current-thread Tokio runtime, `LocalSet`, reuse-port listener, protocol, and
`LocalHandler` pipeline. Accepted streams, handshakes, and connection tasks
remain on the accepting worker. Unsupported platforms fail configuration;
Nacelle does not silently switch runtime topology.

Serial mutable-state listeners support plain TCP, required OpenSSL, optional
OpenSSL detection, and Unix sockets in the shared runtime. Worker-local serial
listeners support plain TCP, required OpenSSL, and optional OpenSSL detection.
Rustls serial and worker-local Unix socket serial variants are not exposed.

`ThreadPerCoreConfig::with_max_threads(...)` caps the selected worker set after
automatic or explicit selection and before any worker thread is created. It
does not configure the caller-owned shared Tokio runtime.

Thread-per-core resource accounting is selected statically at startup. Global
mode shares all existing counters. Worker mode partitions finite connection,
request, streaming, and per-peer capacities in configured worker order while
retaining a single shared FIFO hard memory ceiling for process safety.
Worker factories execute once per worker. Process-wide client pools, backend
limits, and other external resource budgets must be shared explicitly when they
must not scale with worker count.

HTTP-specific edge policy remains in `nacelle-http`: Host, method, URI/header
shape checks, per-peer request rate limits, access logging, and security header
injection. TCP keeps protocol semantics in the protocol implementation and
shared lifecycle/limit enforcement in core.

## Runtime State

`NacelleRuntimeState` owns shared budgets and counters. Connection, request, and
streaming-task limits are non-blocking atomic bounded counters. Memory uses a
checked allocation guard that releases on drop.

This keeps the common request path allocation-light while still enforcing
bounded defaults.

## Bodies

`NacelleBody` has three internal shapes:

- empty/single chunk for fast small responses
- buffered chunks for decoded TCP bodies already in memory
- streaming channel for request/response bodies that move asynchronously

TCP large request bodies reserve their declared length while streaming. HTTP
request bodies reserve `Content-Length` when Hyper exposes a bounded size hint.
TCP protocols can override `Protocol::max_request_body_bytes(...)` to choose a
phase-aware body limit from the decoded head, immutable connection metadata,
and concrete connection state immediately after head decoding and before
body-specific allocation or additional body reads.

## Shutdown

Listeners own a `JoinSet` of accepted connection tasks. Shutdown proceeds in
stages:

1. signal shutdown
2. stop accepting
3. drain active connection tasks
4. abort remaining tasks after the drain deadline
5. emit shutdown telemetry

Task tracking is at the connection boundary, not the per-request hot path.

## Observability

Telemetry is deliberately low-cardinality. Reasons are static strings such as
`connections`, `request_body_bytes`, or `http_body_read`.

Nacelle emits through the backend-neutral `metrics` facade and does not own an
exporter. Runtime state and shared memory budgets cache gauge handles and update
them at existing acquire/release transitions. `NacelleTelemetry` owns lifecycle,
request, phase, error, and byte metrics for all transports. Transports that can
provide extra low-cardinality detail attach a `NacelleMetricsContext` with
listener, protocol, transport, and TLS labels. Applications must install their
recorder before constructing these values so cached handles bind to it; without
a recorder the handles are no-ops.

Request metric switches live under `NacelleTelemetryConfig::request_metrics`.
Started/completed counters and byte counters are on by default; in-flight
counters and duration histograms are disabled by default. TCP phase histograms
additionally require the non-default `phase-timing` Cargo feature. Enable them
deliberately with `NacelleTelemetry::default()` builder methods on the server or
app when you need diagnostic detail and can afford the extra timers and metric
writes. Without `phase-timing`, TCP phase timer storage and `Instant` calls are
not compiled. Core/HTTP request paths do not start a request timer unless
duration metrics or HTTP access logging are enabled.
